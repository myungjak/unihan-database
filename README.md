# unihan-database
For review of draft Unihan database changes, removals, and additions by experts.

Each provisional Unihan field being worked on has its own file. At the moment,
these are:

- kCantonese.txt
- kDefinition.txt
- kSpoofingVariant.txt
- kZVariant.txt

Changes to fields which are not provisional require UTC approval. As such,
the appropriate way to request changes is through a UTC document, not
a pull request.

The *format* for the files is exactly as they appear in the Unihan database,
e.g.,

`U+4E95	kCantonese	zeng2`

Remember to use tabs instead of spaces.

Use Slack for general discussions and requests that other fields be added.
